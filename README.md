# Project Name
> Multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 

# Problem statement: 
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- This assignment uses a dataset of about 2357 images of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.
- Model-1 without data augmentation and class imbalance handling, The Validation accuracy is far less than the Training Accuracy which is clear indication of Overfit of the model. 
- Model-2 with data augmentation and dropout 
- Model-3 with data augmentation, dropout and class imbalance handling
